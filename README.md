# Sales_Reporting_Automation
This program automates the biweekly sales reporting for [The Beverly Collective](https://www.thebeverlycollective.co/).

The automation begins with the Item Details Transactions Report available for download from [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en) and leverages Google API and Auth client libraries to produce email drafts to send to vendors with details on their reporting period payout. The program also produces filtered screenshots of each vendor's transactions for the period to attach to the email drafts.

Future work will aim to attach the .png files to the email drafts programatically as they are produced.
